# IntelliSubDownloader

A python script that downloads subtitles from "yifysubtitles.com" and renames the subtitles same as that of the movie . Multiple files are not supported so there should be only one video file in the directory . Please give suggestions to improve the script .

1. Put the python script inside movie folder which contains only one video file .
2. Then open the python script (or run the batch file) and type the movie name without any alphanumeric characters .
3. Confirm by pressing "Y" or "N" .
4. Script will automatically find , download , rename the subtitle for you .
5. And then it will delete itself so make sure to take a backup of the script .

Enjoy !

Requires Python 3.6 to be installed .
