# IntelliSubDownloader
A python script that downloads subtitles from [Yify Subtitles](https://www.yifysubtitles.com) and renames the subtitles same as that of the movie. Multiple files are not supported so there should be only one video file in the directory. Suggestions are welcomed to improve the script.

1. Put the python script inside the folder which contains only one video file.
2. Then run the python script and type the movie name without any alphanumeric characters.
3. Follow instructions.
4. Script will automatically find , download , extract and rename the subtitle for you.

**Requires Python 3.6+ to be installed and properly configured.**
